## Cycle Benchmark Template in C    

Build template:     
Run the *build_script.sh* bash script. It might be necessary to apply 
```bash
chmod +x
```
to the script.    
    
Dependencies:  

* cmake
    * can be installed easily and platform independent with the package installer for Python.  
    The advantage is that the version is more or less recent, unlike most build packages.
    * ```bash
      pip install cmake
      ```  
* clang or gcc
